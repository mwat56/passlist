## Purpose

Sometimes there is a need to password-protect your web-server, either in whole or just some parts of it.
That's were this little package comes in.
It offers to simply integrate the popular [BasicAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) mechanism into your own web-server.

> **Note**: To be on the safe side your web-server should use `HTTPS` instead of plain old `HTTP` to avoid the chance of someone eavesdropping on the username/password transmission.

## Installation

You can use `Go` to install this package for you:

    go get -u github.com/mwat56/passlist

Then in your application you add

    import "github.com/mwat56/passlist"

and use the provided functions (discussed below) as you see fit.

## Usage

`PassList` provides an easy way to handle HTTP Basic Authentication by simply calling the package's `Wrap()` function and implementing the `TAuthDecider` interface which only requires the single function or method

    NeedAuthentication(aRequest *http.Request) bool

That function may decide on whatever means necessary whether to grant access (returning `true`) or deny it (returning `false`).

For your ease there are two `TAuthDecider` implementations provided: `TAuthSkipper` (which generally returns `false`) and `TAuthNeeder` (which generally returns `true`).
Just instantiate one of those – or, of course, your own implementation – and pass it to the `Wrap()` function.

    func Wrap(aHandler http.Handler, aRealm, aPasswdFile string, aAuthDecider TAuthDecider) http.Handler

The arguments mean:

* `aHandler`: the HTTP handler you implemented for your web-server; you will use the return value of `Wrap()` instead after you called this function.

* `aRealm`: the name of the host/domain to protect (this can be any string you like); it will be shown by most browsers when the username/password is requested.

* `aPasswdFile`: the name of the password file that holds all the username/password pairs to use when authentication is actually required.

* `aAuthDecider`: the deciding function we talked about above.

So, in short: implement the `TAuthDecider` interface and call `passlist.Wrap(…)`, and you're done.

However, the package provides a `TPassList` class with methods to work with a username/password list.
It's fairly well documented, so it shouldn't be too hard to use it on your own if you don't like the automatic handling provided by `Wrap()`.
You can create a new instance by either calling `passlist.LoadPasswords(aFilename string)` (which, as its name says, tries to load the given password file at once), or you call `passlist.NewList(aFilename string)` (which leaves it to you when to actually read the password file by calling the `TPassList` object's `Load()` method).

There's an additional convenience function called `passlist.Deny()` which sends an _"Unauthorised"_ notice to the remote host in case the remote user couldn't be authenticated; this function is called internally whenever your `TAuthDecider` required authentication and wasn't given valid credentials from the remote user.

To further improve the safety of the passwords they are _peppered_ before hashing and storing them.
The default _pepper_ value can be read by calling

	pepper := passlist.Pepper()

And the _pepper_ value can be changed by calling

	myPepper := "This is my common 'pepper' value for the user passwords"
	passlist.SetPepper(myPepper)

> **Note**: Changing the _pepper_ value _after_ storing user/password pairs will invalidate all existing userlist entries!

Please refer to the [source code documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/mwat56/passlist#TPassList) for further details ot the `TPassList` class.

In the package's `./app` folder you'll find the `passlist.go` program which implements the maintenance of password files with the following options:

	-add string
		<username> name of the user to add to the file (prompting for the password)
	-chk string
		<username> name of the user whose pass to check (prompting for the password)
	-del string
		<username> name of the user to remove from the file
	-file string
		<filename> name of the passwordfile to use (default "pwaccess.db")
	-lst
		list all current usernames from the list
	-q    whether to be quiet or not (suppress screen output)
	-upd string
		<username> name of the user to update in the file (prompting for the password)

## Password list

This library provides a couple of functions you can use in your own program to maintain your own password list without having to use the `TPassList` class directly.

* `AddUser(aUser, aFilename string)` reads a password for `aUser` from the commandline and adds it to `aFilename`.
* `CheckUser(aUser, aFilename string)` reads a password for `aUser` from the commandline and compares it with the one stored in `aFilename`.
* `DeleteUser(aUser, aFilename string)` removes the entry for `aUser` from the password list stored in `aFilename`.
* `ListUsers(aFilename string)` reads `aFilename` and lists all users stored in that file.
* `UpdateUser(aUser, aFilename string)` reads a password for `aUser` from the commandline and updates the entry in the password list in `aFilename`.

> **Note**: All these functions _do not return_ to the caller but terminate the respective program with error code `0` (zero) if successful, or `1` (one) otherwise.

## Libraries

The following external libraries are used building `PassList`:
